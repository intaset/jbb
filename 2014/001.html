    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Hydrolysis of ethyl acetate and starch in water and of cellulose in an ionic liquid by using HY and HZSM-5 solid acid catalysts are compared.  In water, HZSM-5 is more active than HY.  This trend is reversed in ionic liquid.  Reactivity differences are explained based on interactions between solvent and catalyst acid site local environments, which depend on zeolite channel structure and Si/Al ratio.  Greater hydrolysis reactivity is achieved when the ionic strength of the reaction media is high.  This is a consequence of ion exchange, allowing for transfer of catalyst protons to the reaction media, where they can more effectively protonate ester and glycosidic functionalities.  Water interacts more strongly with HY acid sites, presumably because the lower Si/Al ratio results in framework channels that are more hydrophilic.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Hydrolysis of biomass to release
sugars that are subsequently converted to alcohols is one of several processes
being investigated as a means to lessen dependence on non-renewable fuels. 
Biomass hydrolysis can be accomplished by using enzymes or through the use of
acid catalysts.  The use of solid rather than liquid acids is potentially
advantageous because the acid could be removed by filtration and recycled after
hydrolysis.  Many solid acid catalysts have been evaluated for biomass
hydrolysis under various reaction conditions [1].  Results from these studies
suggest that catalyst effectiveness depends on numerous factors, making
structure-activity comparisons and reaction mechanism elucidations difficult.</p>

<p class="body">HZSM-5 and HY zeolites were among
the first solid acid catalysts employed for hydrolysis in liquid media.  HZSM-5
and HY are silica-alumina catalysts with well defined but different pore
structures.  Ethyl acetate hydrolysis catalyzed by these zeolites in 60 <sup>o</sup>C
water revealed that the first order rate constant when HZSM-5 was employed was
about 40 times greater than when HY was employed [2].  This large difference in
catalytic activity was attributed to unspecified skeletal differences in the
zeolite structures.  Hydrolysis activity was found to vary with zeolite Si/Al
ratio for both catalysts, with the optimum for HZSM-5 at about 47 and the
optimum ratio for HY near 3.  Dhepe, et al. [3] compared a variety of solid
catalysts for hydrolysis by heating aqueous sucrose solutions for 6h at 80 <sup>o</sup>C
and found that HZSM-5 had no activity (HY was not tested).  They explained this
finding based on steric considerations.  The sucrose molecule was too large to
enter HZSM-5 pores, making catalytic active sites inaccessible.  In contrast,
Jiang, et al. [4] reported that HZSM-5 was active for starch hydrolysis in
water (22% conversion, 120 <sup>o</sup>C, 4h) and to a lesser extent for
cellulose hydrolysis (&lt;1% conversion, 150 <sup>o</sup>C, 40 min).  Starch
and cellulose molecules are much larger than sucrose, so these results appear
to conflict with results reported by Dhepe et al.  Interestingly, when
cellulose was dissolved in an ionic liquid containing small amounts of water,
HY exhibited a relatively high activity for hydrolysis (50% glucose, 130 <sup>o</sup>C,
2h) [5].</p>

<p class="body">Results from studies of HZSM-5 and HY catalyzed hydrolysis
under a variety of reaction conditions are presented here.  Comparing the
properties of these zeolites under identical reaction conditions provides
insight into the importance of solid acid structure and solvent on catalytic
activity.  Detailed studies of reactions catalyzed by these zeolites lead to a
better understanding of solid acid catalyzed biomass hydrolysis mechanisms and
the roles of acid sites located within pores.</p>





<h4> 2. Experimental </h4>

<p class="body">Reagent grade chemicals and
distilled water were used for hydrolysis reactions.  Cellulose and
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl) ionic liquid were used as
received from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).  The sodium form Y zeolite (NaY)
was obtained from Honeywell UOP (Y-54, Si/Al=5.30, Des Plaines, IL).  NaY (1 g)
was mixed with ammonium nitrate (0.25 mol) in water and the mixture was
refluxed with constant stirring for 4 hours.  The solid was filtered and then
air dried prior to calcination at 550°C for 3 hours to produce HY.  HZSM-5
(Si/Al=19) was synthesized by using the procedure described in the Mobil Oil
U.S. Patent (US 3702886). </p>

<p class="body">The mmol H<sup>+</sup> available
from the solid catalysts was determined by using a back titration method with
phenolphthalein indicator.  Catalysts (0.1 g) were added to a sodium hydroxide
solution (0.01 M, 25 mL) and stirred for 10 minutes.  Mixtures were then
centrifuged and the liquid was removed.  A 10mL aliquot of the liquid was then
titrated with oxalic acid (0.01 M) to a pink to clear color change end point.</p>

<p class="body">The ethyl acetate hydrolysis test
solution was a mixture of 5% (vol) ethyl acetate (EA) and 5% (vol) propanol (P)
in distilled water.  Propanol did not react and was therefore used as an
internal standard.  The catalyst (0.01 g) and 5% EA/P solution (0.4 mL) were
loaded into a quartz tube reactor and pressurized to a minimum of 2 MPa with
nitrogen gas.  The reactor was heated isothermally for 30 minutes at
temperatures ranging from 70 to 150°C followed by immersion in a cold-water
bath to quench the reaction.  The reaction mixture was analyzed by using an HP
5890 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection and a Carbowax fused
silica column (Agilent 113-2132).  All chromatographic analyses were performed
with splitless injection.  </p>

<p class="body">For starch hydrolysis in aqueous
media, catalyst (0.01 g) and 1% starch solution (0.4 mL) were mixed and loaded
into the reactor and pressurized to at least 2 MPa with nitrogen gas and then
heated isothermally at 150°C for up to 2 hours followed by immersion in a
cold-water bath to quench the reaction.  Samples for starch hydrolysis in Na<sup>+</sup>
enriched aqueous media were prepared in a similar manner except that the
reaction medium was sodium chloride solution.</p>

<p class="body">For cellulose hydrolysis in an
ionic liquid medium, cellulose (0.1 g) was first dissolved in [EMIM]Cl (2 g) by
using a temperature controlled oil bath to maintain a temperature of 120°C. 
After dissolution, the temperature was lowered to 105°C and distilled water
(0.3 mL) was added in increments of 0.05 mL with constant stirring.  Catalyst
(0.25 g) was then added to this homogenous mixture.  The hydrolysis reaction
was carried out for 3 hours and the solution was sampled at 15 minute intervals
for total reducing sugar assays conducted by using the Benedict's method [6].  </p>

<p class="body">Zeolite structures were determined by using a Rigaku
Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer.  Pattern matching and mineral assignments were
made by using MDI JADE 9 software.  Zeolites were also analyzed by diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) by using a Mattson
Instruments Nova Cygni 120 spectrophotometer (Madison, WI) and a modified
Harrick Scientific Inc. (Ossining, NY) praying mantis diffuse reflection
accessory with environmental chamber [7].  The DRIFTS sample temperature was
maintained at 200°C under flowing He for 45 min to remove adsorbed water from
catalyst surfaces.  Infrared spectra were then measured at 200°C. </p>





<h4> 3. Results and Discussion </h4>

<p class="subhead"> 3.1. Ethyl Acetate Hydrolysis </p>

<p class="body">Aqueous phase hydrolysis of ethyl acetate is commonly used
as a test reaction for assessing the "water tolerance" of solid acid catalysts [8-13]. 
Typically, hydrolysis reactions are carried out with 5% ethyl acetate aqueous
solutions at 60 or 70 <sup>o</sup>C for 2 hours.  Ethyl acetate hydrolysis
reactions were conducted with HZSM-5 and HY catalysts at temperatures varying
from 70 to 150 <sup>o</sup>C in order to characterize their water tolerances
over a wide temperature range.  This temperature range was selected to extend
into the range often employed for biomass hydrolysis.  The molecular dimensions
of ethyl acetate (ca. 4.95 Å) [14] are smaller than HZSM-5 and HY channels, so
internal acid sites should be accessible.  Hydrolysis was carried out for 30
min followed by analysis of the reaction mixture to measure the loss of ethyl
acetate (i.e. conversion) and formation of ethanol and acetic acid products.</p>

<p class="body">HZSM-5 exhibited increasing activity for ethyl acetate
hydrolysis with increasing reaction temperature (Figure 1).</p>

</figure>


<p class="body">HY activity also increased with temperature, but was found
to be comparable to a blank measurement (i.e. no catalyst).  Catalytic activity
associated with the blank measurement was due to an increase in H<sup>+</sup>
activity with increasing temperature, which is a consequence of larger water
autoprotolysis equilibrium constants at higher temperatures [15].  The results
shown in Figure 1 are consistent with reports by Kamiya et al. [13]and Okuhara
et al. [16], who found that HY was inactive for ethyl acetate hydrolysis at 70
and 60°C respectively after 2 hours, and by Namba et al. [2], who reported that
HZSM-5 performed better than HY for ethyl acetate hydrolysis in water.   Drago,
et al. [16] determined that all HZSM-5 acid sites are located inside zeolite
channels.  Therefore, ethyl acetate must diffuse into HZSM-5 channels and the
ethanol and acetic acid products must diffuse out into the aqueous medium. 
Because HY supercage acid sites would be more accessible to ethyl acetate than
those located in HZSM-5 channels, the greater ethyl acetate hydrolysis activity
for HZSM-5 cannot be explained by steric effects.  Concerning the lack of
activity for HY, Kerr reported that HY can lose 25% of its original Bronsted
acidity just by being exposed to water for 10-15 minutes [17].  In addition,
Parker et al. [18] found that the HY framework could be destroyed by exposure
to small amounts of water followed by heating to 300 <sup>o</sup>C.  They postulated
that water reacts to form AlOH and SiOH species at the expense of framework
Al-O-Si bonds.  When multiple Al-O-Si bonds are broken, extra-framework
Al-O(OH) species may be formed [19].   This dealumination process destroys the
HY framework.  Although the HY catalyst used for the ethyl acetate hydrolysis
experiments described here was not heated as high as 300 <sup>o</sup>C, which
would have destroyed the zeolite channel structure, it is possible that some
-Al(OH)<sub>n</sub> (n = 1,2) framework species were formed.  Formation of
-Al-OH and -Si-OH species would disrupt the zeolite framework in the vicinity
of delocalized negative charges associated with acid sites, and could be
responsible for the observed loss of HY acidity.  This hypothesis is consistent
with a report from Scherzer and Bass [20], who found that –Si-OH and –Al-OH
groups formed by reactions with water did not interact with pyridine.  In
contrast to HY, HZSM-5 exhibited acid catalyst activity that was significantly
greater than the blank.  If water also reacted with the HZSM-5 framework, the
effects were not as extensive as for HY.  HZSM-5 may be more stable in water
because of its larger Si/Al ratio, which makes it more hydrophobic than HY [21]. </p>


<p class="subhead"> 3.2. Starch Hydrolysis </p>

<p class="body">Starch, a glucose polymer, is
much larger than ethyl acetate, and should not pass into zeolite channels. 
Like ethyl acetate hydrolysis, HY catalyzed starch hydrolysis results were
comparable to the blank (13 and 14% total reducing sugar yields respectively
after 2 hours at 150 <sup>o</sup>C). However, HZSM-5 exhibited activity for
starch hydrolysis that was significantly greater than the blank measurement
(32% reducing sugar yield).  Jiang et al. [4] also found that HZSM-5 was active
for starch hydrolysis (120°C, 4 hr, microwave reactor), resulting in a 22%
glucose yield.  Considering that steric effects should prevent starch molecules
from accessing HZSM-5 channels, this catalytic activity is surprising.  The
HZSM-5 acid site locations may play a role in its activity for starch
hydrolysis.  If  HZSM-5 contains no external acid sites, as proposed by Drago
et al. [16], starch molecules must have some access to internal sites.  When a
substrate is too large to enter HZSM-5 channels, the acid sites located near
channel openings may still be accessible.  Alternatively, HZSM-5 starch
hydrolysis may result from reactions of H<sup>+</sup> released from internal
zeolite channels by ion exchange (vide infra).</p>


<p class="subhead"> 3.3. Starch Hydrolysis in the Presence of Na<sup>+</sup> </p>

<p class="body">Zeolite catalyzed starch
hydrolysis occurs at much lower rates than ethyl acetate hydrolysis because
starch molecules are too large to access internal acid sites.  This limitation
can be overcome by using ion exchange to release zeolite protons into the
aqueous reaction medium [5].  A relatively high concentration of Na<sup>+</sup>
can be used to transfer H<sup>+</sup> from zeolite inner surfaces to the
aqueous medium, which causes a decrease in solution pH.  </p>

<p class="body">When zeolites were immersed in a
0.25 M Na<sup>+</sup>  solution, aqueous phase acidity was found to increase by
ca. 0.3 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g and 0.9 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g for HZSM-5 and HY
respectively, when compared to immersion in water.  This is consistent with
previous studies, which have shown that ion exchange with Na<sup>+</sup> causes
a decrease in the solid-state acidity of zeolites [22, 23].  The substantial
increase in solution H<sup>+</sup> concentration for HY may suggest that the
presence of Na<sup>+</sup> reverses the effects of water on framework bonds
involving Al, but this is not confirmed by results presented here.  The smaller
increase in solution acidity for HZSM-5 may be explained by the difference in
the Si/Al ratios for the zeolites.  HY (Si/Al=5.3) had a much lower Si/Al ratio
than HZSM-5 (Si/Al=19), so there were fewer Al atoms present in HZSM-5, and
therefore fewer acid sites that could participate in ion exchange. </p>

<p class="body">The increase in solution acidity
for HZSM-5 in 0.50 M Na<sup>+</sup> was not significantly different from the
increase observed when higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations were employed
(Figure 2).  On the other hand, results for HY indicated that increasing the
concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> from 0.25 M to 1 M produced an increase in the
amount of acidity imparted to the solution.  Although not shown in Figure 2, 5
M Na<sup>+</sup> resulted in similar solution acidity as was found by using 1 M
Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the amount of H<sup>+</sup> exchanged from HY
had reached a maximum at 1 M Na<sup>+</sup>.  Although the mmol H<sup>+</sup>
transferred to the aqueous solution was relatively constant above 0.50 M NaCl
for HZSM-5, the corresponding acidities for solutions containing HY increased
up to 1 M NaCl.  This may be explained by differences in acid concentrations. 
Fresh HY (2.3 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g) had more than twice the H<sup>+</sup>
contained in the same mass of HZSM-5 (0.9 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g).  The H<sup>+</sup>
released from HY and HZSM-5 in 1 M Na<sup>+</sup> resulted in 80 and 82%
reducing sugar yields for starch hydrolysis, respectively.  </p>

<p class="subhead"> 3.4. Cellulose Hydrolysis in Ionic Liquid </p>

<p class="body">The dramatic increase in
hydrolysis activity observed in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> suggests that
ion exchange is an important process when using zeolite catalysts with liquid
reaction media.  In fact, previous studies have shown that ion exchange rates
are heavily dependent on water content [24, 25].  Thus, an ion exchange
mediated catalytic activity increase would be expected for reactions in high
ionic strength media, such as ionic liquids.  To test the influence of ionic
liquid media on zeolite acidity, HZSM-5 and HY catalysts were mixed with
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl) and heated at 105 <sup>o</sup>C
for one hour.  Titrations of the zeolites after they were exposed to the ionic
liquid revealed significant loss of protons from the solids, presumably by an
ion exchange mechanism [5].  Fresh HZSM-5 and HY catalysts were found to
contain 1.1 and 2.9 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g respectively.  After exposure to the
ionic liquid, these catalysts contained only 0.2 and 1.2 mmol H<sup>+</sup>/g
respectively.  The most likely cause for these acidity losses was ion exchange
of the imidazolium cation (EMIM<sup>+</sup>) for H<sup>+ </sup>[5].  </p>

<p class="body">X-ray diffraction measurements of
solid state [EMIM]Cl indicated that the cation has dimensions of approximately
3.5 x 3 x 6.5 Å (including hydrogens).  Based on these dimensions and the
channel openings for HZSM-5 (5.3 x 5.6 Å) and HY (7.4 x 7.4 Å), it is
reasonable to expect that EMIM<sup>+</sup> could enter the channels of both
zeolites.  EMIM<sup>+</sup> should be able to enter the HY channels at any
orientation.  The smaller HZSM-5 channel, on the other hand, would restrict
entry of EMIM<sup>+</sup> to specific orientations. </p>

<p class="body">Under reaction conditions similar
to those used for aqueous starch hydrolysis, reducing sugar yields from HY
catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis increased faster with increasing temperature
than HZSM-5 during the first hour (Figure 3).  After 1 hour, HY reducing sugar
yield decreased, which was likely due to acid catalyzed sugar decomposition. 
In contrast, HZSM-5 reducing sugar yield increased steadily until about 1.5
hours, and then leveled off.  The trends shown in Figure 3 are consistent with
more protons being released from HY than from HZSM-5 by ion exchange with EMIM<sup>+</sup>. </p>

<p class="body">X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used
to determine if the HY and HZSM-5 structures were significantly altered by
exposure to [EMIM]Cl.  Fresh and spent catalysts (e.g. before and after
cellulose hydrolysis in [EMIM]Cl, respectively) were analyzed.  Comparing the
diffraction patterns for the zeolites before and after reactions revealed 95
and 98% similarities for HY and HZSM-5 structures respectively. </p>

<p class="body">HZSM-5 and HY zeolites were also
analyzed by DRIFTS prior to and after [EMIM]Cl exposure.  Figure 4 shows the
resulting infrared spectra and the ionic liquid spectrum for reference. 
Several overlapping absorbance bands near 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> appear in the
[EMIM]Cl spectrum.  These spectral features represent stretching vibrations for

<p class="body">For HY, two characteristic O-H
stretching vibration bands at 3650 and 3550 cm<sup>-1</sup> are observed that
are indicative of Bronsted acidity [26-28].  For HZSM-5, a broad band centered
near 3600 cm<sup>-1</sup> denotes O-H stretching vibrations associated with
acid sites [29].</p>

<p class="body">After exposure to [EMIM]Cl, HY
and HZSM-5 DRIFTS spectra exhibited absorbances near 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>,
which can be attributed to EMIM<sup>+</sup>.  Bands at 2980, 3107, and 3146 cm<sup>-1</sup>
appear in the HY spectrum.  The HZSM-5 spectrum obtained after exposure to
[EMIM]Cl contains overlapping bands at 2988, 3123, and 3161 cm<sup>-1</sup>. 
Although the EMIM<sup>+</sup> band frequencies are somewhat different for HY
and HZSM-5, the shapes of the absorbance envelopes in this spectral region were
similar for both catalysts.  However, both spectra were significantly different
from the corresponding envelope in the [EMIM]Cl spectrum.  The C-H stretching
vibrations for the immadazole ring carbons are most likely responsible for the
bands above 3100 cm<sup>-1 </sup>[30].  The lower wavenumber band in this
region can be assigned to the C-H stretching vibration associated with the
carbon atom that is attached to both ring nitrogens.  The higher wavenumber
band is most likely associated with C-H stretching vibrations associated with
the other two ring carbons.  In [EMIM]Cl, hydrogen bonding between the ring C-H
functional groups and Cl<sup>-</sup> results in a significant shift of the C-H
stretching vibrations to lower wavenumber [30].  The higher C-H stretching
wavenumbers for the zeolite samples indicate that [EMIM]<sup>+</sup> is trapped
within the zeolite channels and that Cl<sup>-</sup> is not available for
hydrogen bonding, confirming that the ionic liquid was not simply mixed with
the zeolites.  In fact, the cation had migrated into the zeolite channels. 
This conclusion is consistent with a previous report that the average pore
diameter for HY decreased after exposure to an ionic liquid [5].  The slight
differences in absorption maxima wavenumbers for immadazole ring C-H stretching
vibrations for HZSM-5 and HY indicate that the EMIM<sup>+</sup> environments
within zeolite channels are somewhat different.  This is most likely due to
differences in zeolite channel dimensions.</p>





<h4> 4. Conclusions </h4>

<p class="body">When used in liquid media,
zeolite acid catalysts can operate by two modes.  When substrates are small
enough to enter framework channels, they can interact directly with solid acid
sites.  When solutions contain cations that can exchange for zeolite protons,
the reaction medium becomes acidified and acid catalyzed reactions can take
place outside of zeolite channels.  Water reactions with zeolite frameworks can
lead to loss of acid sites.  This effect is more pronounced for HY than HZSM-5
and the degree of acid site loss can be correlated with Si/Al ratios.  Higher
Si/Al ratios result in greater hydrophobicity within zeolite channels and less
water penetration [21].  Namba et al. [2] investigated the effects of Si/Al
ratio on ethyl acetate hydrolysis and found that catalytic activity was optimum
for HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 47.  Below this value, acid site destruction
due to reactions with water may dominate even though the acid site density
increases due to increased framework Al content.  Above the optimum Si/Al
ratio, a lower acid site density may be responsible for decreased catalytic
activity.  The low Si/Al ratio for the HY used for studies described here would
be expected to result in substantial water mediated acid site destruction.  In
fact, no acidity was derived from this catalyst for ethyl acetate or starch
hydrolysis in aqueous solutions.  In contrast, HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 19) exhibited
catalytic activity, so it was affected to a lesser extent than HY. </p>

<p class="body">Results described here suggest
that ion exchange effects should be considered when evaluating new solid acid
catalysts for biomass hydrolysis.  Ion exchange negates the advantage of using
a solid acid, which is easily removed by filtration, because it results in an
increase in solvated protons, in the same manner that could be achieved more
easily by using a liquid acid catalyst.  Clearly, biomass processing schemes
incorporating reusable solid acid hydrolysis catalysts should provide for
proton access to solvated starch and cellulose molecules and a means for
removing the "fully protonated" solid acid after hydrolysis.  This would
eliminate the need for neutralizing solution acidity prior to fermentation. </p>
