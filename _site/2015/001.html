    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Azadiractha Indica (Neem) is one of the promising tree species suitable for providing oil for biodiesel production. This paper addresses the life cycle assessment (LCA) with respect to, global warming potential, acidification potential and energy balance of a small scale biodiesel system using Neem oil as feedstock, in rural Karnataka (a southern state in India). The environmental impacts have been bench marked with the life cycle impacts of fossil diesel system and Jatropha. Global warming potential of Neem biodiesel life cycle (338 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit<sup>-1*</sup>) was found be 1.2 times higher than fossil diesel system (280 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit<sup>-1</sup>) and 2.7 times higher than Jatropha biodiesel system(123.7 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit<sup>-1</sup>). Acidification potential of Neem system was found to be negligible. It is observed that one hectare of Neem plantation is capable of sequestering the 1.35t of biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> released during the Neem biodiesel life cycle, with additional sequestration potential of 8.65 t CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>. Net energy ratio of Neem biodiesel life cycle (22.06) has been found to be 26 times higher than fossil Diesel system and twelve times higher than Jatropha system (1.85). This life cycle study revealed that producing biodiesel from Neem oil is ecologically sustainable.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Neem is an evergreen and deciduous tree
with straight trunk and long spreading branches forming a broad round crown,
growing to height of 12 to 18m. All parts of tree are bitter and the tree has
religious significance. It is spread across the whole of South Asia. In India:
Uttar Pradesh, Tamil-Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra
Pradesh, and Gujarat are important Neem producing states [2].</p>

<p class="body">Neem is one of the most valuable trees in
India. It has many commercially exploited by-products. The tree is medicinally
valuable, because of its anti-allergic, anti-fungal, insecticidal,
anti-dermatic, anti-inflammatory properties etc. In forestry, Neem is
recommended for aforestation of dry areas, soil conservation, reclamation of
alkaline soils and along avenues for shade and ornamental purposes [8, 10, 17].
</p>

<p class="body">Neem is propagated both by seed and by
vegetative methods. At the onset of the rains the seedlings are planted in the
field. Planting distances of 5.5  x 5.5 m (330 plants ha-1) is a common
practice. One-year-old seedlings are best suited for transplanting; around 2-3
kg of farmyard manure is mixed with soil during planting. Seedlings are
irrigated depending on the climatic conditions in the first two years [10, 17].
</p>

<p class="body">Neem grows in full sun and is relatively a
low maintenance tree once established. It is resistant to high winds and
drought [9]. The rate of growth of Neem is found to be rapid up to the age of 5
years (after which, it slows down). The plant attains a height of 4m at 5 years
and reaches 10 m by 25 years. The mean annual girth increment is 2.3 to 3cm. It
is one of the promising tree species suitable for providing oil for biodiesel
production, which conforms to international standards. Oil percentage in Neem
kernel varies from 18-25 %. In addition, the seed cake is also found to have
7-12 % residual oil, which can be extracted through solvent extraction [2, 10].</p>

<p class="body">Neem oil is light brown to dark brown in
colour and bitter in taste with a strong peanut and garlic odour. The bitter
taste and odour are due to presence of large amount of triterpenoid compounds
like azadirachtin. Neem cake is the by-product of the Neem oil industry. It is
used as organic manure. It works as a good nematicide hence, used in fields
infested with nematodes. Since being organic in origin it has little impact on
soil quality, but very effective in controlling / eradicating nematodes, which
cause huge loss in banana plantation [7].</p>

<p class="body">The list of tree borne oil (TBO) species
has been constantly increasing. Many clean development mechanism project
developers are interested in exploiting these tree species for meeting
challenges of energy supply and green house gas (GHG) emission reduction. With
TBO species number increasing, a scientific approach to identify
environmentally sustainable tree species is considered as need of the hour
[22].</p>

<p class="body">A vital requirement for bio-fuels to be a
sustainable alternative fuels is that, it should be produced from renewable
feedstock with a lower negative environmental impact. Consequently, a study is
needed in order to infer whether above requirements are met. Life cycle
assessment (LCA) method has been found to be suitable for evaluating the
environmental impact of biodiesel produced from vegetable oils [21]. </p>

<p class="body">In this paper, an exclusive LCA of a
small-scale biodiesel production system using Neem oil in rural Karnataka has
been presented. The LCA compares the performance of the Neem system with fossil
fuel, and Jatropha biodiesel.</p>

<h4>2. Materials and Methods</h4>

<p class="body">The Neem biodiesel system was assessed
using LCA method according to the International Organization for
Standardization procedures (ISO 14010/44:2006). The goal of this LCA study was
to assess the sustainability of biodiesel production form Neem oil, for
different life cycle stages and the overall life cycle under following impact
categories:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Global Warming Potential (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq)</li>
 <li>Acidification Potential (SO<sub>2</sub>-eq)</li>
 <li>Energy Input and Output analysis (MJ)</li>
</ol>

<p class="subhead">2.1. Life Cycle
Inventory</p>

<p class="body">This LCA study was carried out at 'Biofuel
Park', Agriculture Research Station (ARS) located at Madenur in Hassan district
of Karnataka State. Biofuel Park project has been successful in establishing
465 Farmers associations for growing biodiesel feedstock called "<i>Jaivika
Indhana Beejagala Belegarara Sangha</i>" (which means 'Biofuel Seed Growers
Association' in local Kannada language) and covers about 70 villages designated
as "Complete Biofuel Village" [8]. </p>

<p class="body">Hassan is situated 934 meters above mean
sea level and located between 12&deg; 13' and 13&deg; 33' North latitudes and 75&deg; 33'
and 76&deg; 38' East longitude. This district covers 6826.15&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is
divided into 8 taluks, 38 hoblies &amp; 2369 villages. The geography is mixed
with the mountainous region to the West and South-West called 'Bisle Ghat' and
the plains regions in the North, South and East. There are some areas of
degraded forest ranges in central portion of the district [8].</p>

<p class="subhead">2.2. Phases of
Neem Biodiesel Life Cycle</p>

<p class="body">The LCA of the Neem system included (Fig. 1).</p>

<p class="body">(i) Cultivation phase: This
phase includes, raising seedlings in poly bags in a nursery, transporting it to
planting site, digging pits, filling pits with local farm yard manure, planting
the seedlings, providing life saving irrigation in summer months for first two
years and harvesting fruits for oil extraction after 5 to 6 years, energy
input-output and associated emissions. </p>

<p class="body">(ii) Oil extraction phase:
This phase includes transportation of seeds to oil extraction unit, energy
input-output and associated emissions. </p>

<p class="body">(iii) Esterification phase: This phase includes conversion
of oil into biodiesel, chemicals used and energy input, output and associated
emissions. </p>

<p class="body">(iv) Combustion / usage
phase: This phase includes combusting biodiesel in an engine, its associated
energy and emission</p>

<p class="body">Allocation procedure is the method of
dividing the input or output flows of a process to a system under research. The
ISO standards allow inclusion of by-products within the system boundaries. In case
this by-product substitutes a product usage in the system, it avoids the
conventional production of substituted product. The environmental load of this
avoided production process can be subtracted from the environmental burden of
the system under research (e.g. in biodiesel production seed cake is a
by-product, used as organic fertilizer. By-products, i.e. Neem seed cake
(organic manure) and glycerine have been credited for synthetic fertiliser and
glycerine, which are a by-product of fossil fuel system (Fig.2). The LCA study
focuses on the usage of by-products and the biodiesel locally. One mega joule
(1MJ) of energy available in 27g Neem biodiesel (Fig.1) was considered as the
functional unit (FU) for life cycle impact assessment. This study concentrated
on the Neem plantations on wastelands, degraded lands and agricultural land
bunds and community lands. The boundary conditions of LCA studies of Neem
biodiesel in comparison with fossil fuel has been depicted in figure 1 and 2.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.3. Data
Collection and Analysis</p>

<p class="body">The data was collected by personal
interviews and interaction with farmers associations for calculating the,
global warming potential, acidification potential and energy input and output
(MJ).</p>

<p class="body">To asses the global warming potential and
acidification potential of the Neem system, the associated input factors
mentioned in table.1were considered and duly assessed. System-specific data
(e.g. fertilizer use) were collected from Biofuel Park records while general
data (e.g. field emission rates: N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub> and N leaching
from fertilisers applied to soil were taken from IPCC default factors and FAO)
(IPCC-ID: 1622, IPCC-ID: 417274 &amp; FAO 2013), background data (e.g.
production impact of fertilizer) were collected from literature and databases.
Automobile emission data was collected from literature and reports of
automotive research association of India, Pune [1]. </p>

<p class="body">The data pertaining to energy inputs and
output were collected from Biofuel Park. The means by which, inputs were
transported to the system and intermediate outputs transported between
different systems phases have been accounted for. The transport distances of
the inputs (seedlings, fertilizers, seeds, equipment and machines) were
collected by interacting with farmers, understanding their agronomical
practices.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.4. Fossil
Fuel as Reference System</p>

<p class="body">For a suitable life cycle comparison, the
reference system (Fossil fuel) must provide the same products and functions as
the biodiesel system evaluated [24]. Hence, all products and by-products of the
biodiesel system should be substituted in the reference system. The
substitutions reflect the local situation. Glycerine was considered the only
by-product because the other by-products are ploughed back to the field as soil
enrichment and are not system outputs (Fig. 1). In the reference system the
glycerine is substituted for synthetically produced glycerine of similar
quality (Fig. 3).</p>

<h4>3. Results and Discussion</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1. Global
Warming Potential (GWP)</p>

<p class="body">The Neem biodiesel system showed a total
emission of 338.2 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit <sup>-1
</sup>of which 293 g CO<sub>2</sub> was found to be biogenic (Ref. Table 2), which was found to be on
par with CO<sub>2</sub> emission of fossil fuel (280 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit <sup>-1</sup>) and 1.8
times higher than Jatropha (159.3 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit <sup>-1</sup>) [25]. This higher emission of CO<sub>2-</sub>eq<sub> </sub>in
Neem biodiesel is attributed to wood burnt as fuel in its life cycle [25]. The
cultivation phase (90%) is the biggest contributor for GWP in the system
followed by esterification (5.2%) and oil extraction (4.8%). Although very
little inorganic fertilizer is used in the system, the GWP is found to be twice
than Jatropha system evaluated by Achten et al [25], which uses a considerably
higher amount of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides for better yield.</p>

<p class="body">Neem wood is not preferred as fuel, since it
has good timber value. GWP in absence of fuel wood, would result in the total
emission of 45.72 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq Functional Unit<sup>-1</sup>, which would
be six times lower than fossil diesel system (280gCO2-eq Functional Unit<sup>-1</sup>)
and three times lower than Jatropha biodiesel system(123.7 gCO2-eq Functional
Unit<sup>-1</sup>).</p>

<p class="body">As per calculations made from the data
collected, a five / six year old Neem plantation has a CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestration
capacity of about 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> (Ref.Appendix-1). The
biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission from Neem system is 1.35 tons ha<sup>-1</sup>
(Ref. Table 2). The standing biomass of Neem trees on wasteland can sequester
this biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission and can further sequester additional 8.65
tons of CO<sub>2.</sub></p>

<p class="body">Out of the total 1561011.7 g CO<sub>2 </sub>emission
from Neem biodiesel life cycle<sub>, </sub>biogenic CO<sub>2 </sub>amounts to
1352724.8 g or 293 g CO<sub>2</sub> functional unit<sup>-1</sup> (Biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>
is derived from summation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission from biological inputs
i.e. FYM application [60g] + Fuel wood burning [1350000g] + Biodiesel
combustion [2664.75g]=1352724.8g).</p>

<p class="subhead">3.2.
Acidification Potential (AP)</p>

<p class="body">The Neem system showed a 95% decrease in AP
compared to the reference system. The biggest contribution is due to diesel
combustion for transportation during cultivation phase, which is very
negligible compared to Jatropha system evaluated by [25]. Eutrophication
potential has not been considered, since direct application of inorganic
fertilizer and pesticides is not practiced in the system and in view of the
fact that acidification potential results are quite negligible per functional
unit (Table 3).</p>

<p class="body">Energy output per functional unit is found
to be very high (13.46 MJ) compared to Jatropha system (0.4MJ) analyzed by
Achten et al. [25]. Net energy ratio was found to be 22.06, which is twelve
times higher than Jatropha and Diesel (Ref. Table 6). Lower energy output in
Jatropha may be attributed to lower seed yield in rain fed conditions, higher
plant population, and higher energy inputs in the form of inorganic fertiliser
and pesticides [25].</p>

<p class="body">*Achten et al. 2010</p>

<p class="body">LCA studies revealed that producing
biodiesel from Neem oil is ecologically sustainable (due to its high CO2
sequestration potential). Neem being a tree species from local ecology, it has
very little impact on global warming and higher energy ratio compared to
Jatropha. Planting Neem trees on wasteland triggers an improvement in higher
storage capacity in terms of biomass, structure and biodiversity than the
wasteland. </p>

<p class="body">Unlike Jatropha, which has been debated to
invade cultivable land and create food fuel conflict, Neem's invasion into
cultivable land as main crop is ruled out because of its perennial nature with
life span way above 90 years. Hence, this tree serves as a sustainable
biodiesel feedstock, which can be encouraged to grow on agriculture land bunds,
street sides and wastelands to supplement agro practices of farmers. A
well-planned and executed agro practice along with Neem plantations shall make
significant contribution to local energy needs at rural level.</p>

<h4>Appendix-1</h4>

<p class="body"><b>Methodology for calculating the total above
ground biomass (TAB) and amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered by a tree per
year</b></p>

<p class="body">The rate of carbon sequestration depends on
the growth characteristics of the tree species, the conditions for growth where
the tree is planted, and the density of the tree's wood. It is high in the
younger stages of tree growth, between 20 to 50 years. </p>

<p class="body">The process of calculating CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestration
is as follows:</p>

<p class="body">1. Determine the total
(green) weight of the tree.</p>

<p class="body">2. Determine the dry
weight of the tree.</p>

<p class="body">3. Determine the weight of
carbon in the tree.</p>

<p class="body">4. Determine the weight of
carbon dioxide sequestered in the tree</p>

<p class="body">5. Determine the weight of
CO2 sequestered in the tree per year</p>

<p class="body"><b>Determine the total (green) weight of the tree</b></p>

<p class="body">The algorithm to calculate the weight of a
tree is:</p>

<p class="body">W = Above-ground weight of the tree in
pounds</p>

<p class="body">D = Diameter of the trunk in inches</p>

<p class="body">H = Height of the tree in feet</p>

<p class="body">For trees with D &lt; 11:</p>

<p class="body">W = 0.25D2H</p>

<p class="body">For trees with D &gt;= 11:</p>

<p class="body">W = 0.15D2H</p>

<p class="body">Depending on the species, the coefficient
(e.g. 0.25) could change, and the variables D and H could be raised to
exponents just above or below 1 </p>

<p class="body">However, these two equations could be seen
as an "average" of all the species' equations.</p>

<p class="body">The root system weighs about 20% as much as
the above-ground weight of the tree.</p>

<p class="body">Therefore, to determine the total green
weight of the tree, multiply the above-ground weight of the tree by 120%.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Determine the dry weight of the tree</b></p>

<p class="body">The average tree is 72.5% dry matter and
27.5% moisture.</p>

<p class="body">Therefore, to determine the dry weight of
the tree, multiply the weight of the tree by 72.5%.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Determine the weight of carbon in the tree</b></p>

<p class="body">The average carbon content is generally 50%
of the tree's total volume. Therefore, to determine the weight of carbon in the
tree, multiply the dry weight of the tree by 50%.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Determine the weight of carbon dioxide sequestered in
the tree</b></p>

<ul>
 <li>CO2 is composed of one molecule of Carbon and 2
     molecules of Oxygen.</li>
 <li>The atomic weight of Carbon is 12.001115.</li>
 <li>The atomic weight of Oxygen is 15.9994.</li>
 <li>The weight of CO2 is C+2*O=43.999915.</li>
 <li>The ratio of CO2 to C is
     43.999915/12.001115=3.6663.</li>
 <li>Therefore, to determine the weight of carbon
     dioxide sequestered in the tree, multiply the weight of carbon in the tree
     by 3.6663</li>
</ul>

<p class="body"><b>Determine the weight of CO2 sequestered in the tree
per year</b></p>

<p class="body">Divide the weight of carbon dioxide
sequestered in the tree by the age of the tree.</p>
