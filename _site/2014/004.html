    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>There is presented technical-technological analysis of
decentralised energy production in cogeneration cycle using plant biomass and
biofuels. It was determined that in perspective in Lithuania power of power
plants heated by biofuel shall reach 10-15 MW. Having evaluated the amount of
growth of oily cultures in Lithuania, possibilities to use vegetable oil and
its blends with mineral diesel in cogeneration power plants were proven. Distribution
of energy flows in 1050 kW cogeneration power plant with diesel engine was
presented. It was defined that mechanical power of the engine is twice smaller
than the obtained heat power of the module. Having performed the environmental evaluation
of biofuels, it was determined that the least emission of CO and solid particles
to the environment was got using rapeseed oil fuels. However, during its
burning bigger amount of NO<sub>x</sub> gets into the air if compared to
mineral diesel or rapeseed ester methyl. Tasks requiring scientific research
were formulated. These tasks shall optimise the possibility to use biofuels in
cogeneration power plants using internal combustion engines. There is presented
technical-economical assessment of cogeneration
power plants using rapeseed oil for fuel.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Cogeneration
is one of the key measures to reduce the prime-cost of electricity production
using existing technologies. Considering energetic value of the used energy as
100%, during cogeneration cycle we receive 45% of electrical energy and 40-45%
of thermal energy, and loss of energy production makes only 10-15% [1]. The
main condition for effective operation is stable demand for thermal energy.
Electrical energy is a by-product of the technological process. In Europe, in
the long run this technology has been little widespread in the energy market.
In 1998, the installed capacity of this type of power plants accounted for
about 70 GW, and only in the recent years the average power of the plant has
exceeded the limit of 10 MW. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Europe, with a large
part of the centrally prepared and supplied thermal energy, cogeneration power
plants make a considerably larger share of energy balance. Cogeneration energy
generated by the energy market is increased in two ways: construction of
commercial energy facilities for production of heat or cold; construction of
micro-generational objects (&quot;household power system"). The target was to
produce about 20% of electric energy in cogeneration power plants in 2013. This
fact became the basis for the European Commission (EC) to issue a directive
promoting construction of cogeneration power plants and legal basis supporting
application of this technology [2].</p>

<p class="body">Electricity generation in cogeneration mode is an effective way
to reduce environmental pollution, economical use of non-renewable and expand use of
renewable energy resources. The European Union has a large potential to
expand the use of this technology. Taking into account different level of economic development and specifics of
industry and its conditions, the European Commission granted Member States freedom in decision making.</p>

<p class="body">In the
recent years, a particular focus is placed
on usage of biomass, biofuels and alternative
fuels in cogeneration cycle and efficiency increase [3, 4, 5, 6].</p>

<p class="body">In the European Union,
the biggest part of boiler plants heated by biomass is made by boiler plants of
small and medium power with the nominal power from 10 to 150 MW. In such
systems, heat needs in summer and transitional period are only 3-15 MW. In
cogeneration regime in such boiler plants it is possible to install electric
generators with the power from several hundred to several megawatts. As it is proven
by the performed analysis, cogeneration energy objects are economically effective
only if they annually operate not less than 7-8 thousand hours [6]. Another precondition
to carry out this project is sufficient amount of biomass for fuel production
in the region, its offer and price. Strong competition is characteristic to the
market of wooden waste. The market is composed of producers of wooden fibre and
sawdust, cellulose and paper producers, private sector and recently appeared in
the market wooden briquettes and granules producers. Less competition is found
in the market of wood waste and especially for biomass grown plants.
Transportation distance for correctly chosen biomass suppliers should not
exceed 50 km.</p>

<p class="body">Presently, some
main electricity generation technologies are applied. First is a steam boiler
with steam turbine. Chopped wood, straw and energetic plants may be used for
fuel production. In boilers of smaller power (5-10 MW), it is hard to reach
high parameters of technological steam (400-600&deg;C temperature and 700-800 km/h
steam supply to the turbine speed). Coefficient of efficiency of the system (if
generating electricity up to 1 MW of the installed power) makes 10-15%. Condensate
heat exchanger in burning product channels may partly improve coefficient of
efficiency. The accumulated in biomass energy may be fully used by producing
heat energy. Used in condensate heat exchanger steam heats hot water. In this
way, 60-70% of the primary energy is used purposefully [5; 6].</p>

<p class="body">A system
using a steam piston engine with closed working heat cycle instead of a turbine
is characterised by higher technological parameters. The engine works without
pulling of working cylinder surfaces. Depending on technological steam
parameters, one and two/three extension cycle engines are produced. Engines are
of a simple construction and are easy to maintain. Range of power is wide
enough - from 100 to 1000 kW in one block, and steam demand is up to 40 t/h. The
main advantage of a steam engine if compared to a steam turbine is a
possibility to work in loads' range from 20 to 100% with constant energy
generation coefficient of efficiency higher than 50%. In energetic power blocks
up to 1 MW, a steam engine guarantees 2-5% higher coefficient of efficiency
than steam turbine. </p>

<p class="body">Recently, energetic
blocks working on ORC (<i>Organic Rankine Cycle) </i>cycle was appeared and started
to be exploited [7; 8]. Differently from a common water-steam cycle, organic
liquid (isooctane, toluene, silicon oils) is used for heat transition in
operating frame. Temperature of a heat-transfer agent (310&deg;C) is not high. The
system operates in the closed cycle. Differently from water-steam turbines, ORC
cycle is characterised by a turbine of smaller rotation, and small load of
mechanic turbine. Apart from that, operating surfaces of the blades are safe
from erosion, complicated water preparation technology is not needed, and
coefficient of efficiency is higher with the higher load of the aggregate. In
this power plant, waste of heat and electricity make only 3-5%, and coefficient
of efficiency of electricity production is 0.18. The remaining part of energy
is used for heat production in cogeneration regime. </p>

<p class="body">Despite their
simplicity, all the mentioned schemes are hardly fully automated and cannot
operate fully autonomously. ORC cycle power plants are in the initial launching
stage and are related to high investment costs. To this end, usage of
stationary internal combustion engines has more advantages. Their construction
is quite perfect, and it is adopted by the producers. Cogeneration energetic
power modules up to 10 MW are produced. Power costs of the installed power
plant are from 580 to 1620 EUR/kWe. Another important characteristic of
internal combustion engines is quick launch and reach of the maximal power and high
elasticity in wide range of powers. Either liquid or gas fuel may be used for
production of fuels. Modern blocks may be managed distantly and operate in the
regime of constant generation and autogeneration. Table 1 presents comparison
of energetic efficiency for cogeneration power plants with the power up to 10
MW using biomass [7; 8; 9; 10].</p>

<p class="body">Having
evaluated the provided data in view of energetic efficiency, variants of power
plants shall be arranged as follows: gas Otto engine, gas turbine, gas turbine
with STIG cycle, steam turbine, ORC cycle turbine, steam engine. If burning
biomass directly, coefficient of efficiency of generation of electric energy
makes approx. 20%. If biomass is burned in a power plant with integrated
biomass gasification, coefficient of efficiency is up to 38% [11]. However,
launching of such technology is stopped by high investment costs. Technological
process is rather complicated and takes place at high temperature (700-1200&deg;C).
Depending on quality of the initial raw materials, caloricity of the obtained
gas blend is from 3 to 7 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>, and it is not high. </p>

<p class="body">Biogas
obtained in bioreactors during splitting of biomass by microorganisms in
non-oxygen environment may be used as fuel. The obtained gas blend is composed
of methane (40-80%), carbon (20-55%) and hydrogen sulphide (0.1-5.5 %) [12; 13].
Various raw materials may be used for production of biogas. Apart from plant
mass, one may use litter, waste products of food industry and forage, silt of
waste waters, waste of public utilities and wood processing.</p>

<p class="body">Differently
from usual power plants, in cogeneration power plant additional heat exchangers
are installed. These heat exchangers enable to get heat from biogas compressor,
systems of engine cooling and lubrication and channel of the exhaust. Part of
heating (approx. 15 %) and electric (7.5&nbsp;%) energy is used for internal
technological needs, such as maintenance of bioreactor's temperature regime,
preparation of biomass, cleaning and conditioning of biomass, and sorting of
waste. Biogas that is formed in dumps and purifiers can also be used for
internal combustion engines. Recently corn has become a perspective plant
biomass used for production of biogas in reactors. 700 m<sup>3</sup> of biogas
may be obtained from one ton of dry organic mass that contains approx. 50 % of
methane. Prime cost of biogas is 0.12-0.13 EUR/m<sup>3</sup>, and the price of
the cleaned and prepared for burning gas (bio-methane) is 0.26-0.32 EUR/m<sup>3</sup>.
Corn plantation of 150 ha (if crop capacity is not less than 50 t/ha) enable
you to get about 1.5 million cubic meters of gas. This quantity is sufficient
for operation of cogeneration module 370 kW electric and 440 kW heat power of
8000 hours per year [13].</p>

<p class="body">From the
technological point of view, the easiest realised variant is usage of vegetable
oils and biofuels in cogeneration power plants. If compared to the
above-mentioned variants, changes in engine fuel supply system are minimal:
exchange of system sealing elements by the ones resistant to vegetable oils and
installation of heating system of the supplied fuels. A big advantage of this
variant consists in the fact that without stopping operation of the power plant
you may change a sort of the used fuel. This saves from stoppage of the
energetic module in case of disorder in biofuel supply. </p>

<p class="body">Vegetable oil and biofuel use in cogeneration cycle in Lithuania
also promotes biomass produced in agriculture and resources of products obtained from this biomass. The resources
of hydroelectric power plants, wind energy are high temperature geothermal
resources in Lithuania are minimal. There are no possibilities to use sources
of flood energy and high temperature solar energy. In the nearest future, the
major part of the produced clean energy shall be made by energy blocks using
biomass. Potential of plant biomass utilization for energy purposes is
presented in figure 1 [14, 15]. </p>

purposes in Lithuania's agriculture (the currently used
amounts are presented in block) [14, 15]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">In recent
years the interest in usage of vegetable oil for fuel production in some
countries of EU increases [16]. In 2009 in Lithuania were produced 108 thousand
tons of biofuels. It is forecasted that this need shall not increase
significantly. Aiming to implement the requirement of the EU that until the
year 2020 biofuels should make 10% of the entire quantity of the used fuel, it
is projected to produce about 110 thousand tons of biofuels that year. In
Lithuania biofuels are usually produced from rapeseeds. It has been determined
that rape for production of biofuels shall be grown in the area of 290 thousand
ha. </p>

<p class="body">Development
of biofuels production is supported not only by higher interest to environment
protection and constantly increasing price of mineral fuels, but also desire of
people involved in agriculture to depend less on energy market. Using vegetable
oil in tractors and cars, a farmer may provide himself with fuels by growing
vegetable plants himself and use the cake to feed domestic animals. Based on
the performed research results it was determined that the biggest yield of oil
is in rapeseed - up to 45 %, sunflower seeds - up to 40 %, oily radish - up to
35 %, oily linseeds - up to 35%, soya - up to 24%. However, not all
oils are suitable for fuels due to their physical-chemical characteristics.
Rapeseed oil is the most suitable. Table 2 provides the main characteristics of
rapeseed oil, biodiesel and mineral diesel [17].</p>

<p class="body">As we may see from these data, rapeseed oil (if compared to
biodiesel and mineral diesel) is characteristic of the following: its quagmire
is much higher, boundary filter temperature is higher, cetane number is lower.
Rapeseed oil is non-toxic and is rather fireproof. Differently from mineral oil
products, rapeseed oil does not have objectionable odour and taste. This oil
does not contain sulphur compounds; so, its burning does not form acid rains,
and other dangerous chemical compounds do not get into atmosphere. According to
the calculations, the amount of the separated heat received by burning oil and
diesel fuel is almost the same. Oil has higher outburst temperature which makes
it more attractive for usage in stationary engines installed in enclosed space
[18; 19; 20]. </p>

<p class="body">The
study of the performed analytical research has revealed that growing tendencies to use diesel engines in cogeneration cycle are associated with possible
usage of vegetable oil and
its blends. However, there is lack of
research evaluating environmental
and economic advantages
of such systems. </p>

<p class="body"> The
aim of research was to analyse impact of
vegetable oil usage in cogeneration cycle on the
environment and its economic benefits.</p>

<h4>2. Materials and methods</h4>

<p class="body"> Studies
were conducted in the Lithuanian Institute of Agricultural Engineering. While determining
energetic and emission rates of vegetable oil
usage for fuel, laboratory tests were carried out. Laboratory
bench measurements are presented in figure 2.</p>

</figure>

<p class="body"> Air-cooled engine D144 capacity is 37 kW, displacement is
4.15 l, cylinder diameter /
stroke - 105/120 mm, compression ratio -
16.5. Fuel pumps
ND 21/4 are monocylindrical. </p>

<p class="body"> Three-flow blowguns 6T2 were checked on a stand KI-16301<sup><u>a</u></sup> (stand was produced in the
Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Raudondvaris, Lithuania) and adjusted 17.5
&plusmn; 0.5 MPa
for the initial raise pressure of the needle.</p>

<p class="body"> Before testing, one liter
of oil M-10G2K was added to the engine crankcase. Fuel pump was
adjusted to geometric fuel start-up of 25 &plusmn; 1<sup>0</sup>
to the upper endpoint. </p>

<p class="body"> Engine torque was measured on a stand with accuracy 5%.
Rotation
frequency &#8203;&#8203;was measured by a
digital tachometer TESA (TESA Group, Bergdietikon,
Switzerland,)
with accuracy 1%. Engine state during tests was controlled measuring oil pressure with the accuracy 20
kPa and temperature by logometer
&Scaron; 69000 with TSM resistance thermometer
(TSM Corporation, Bartlett, USA) with accuracy 5<sup>0</sup>C. Effective torque was measured with accuracy 5%.
The force measuring mechanism was tested by objection lever.
Fuel consumption was set by weighing
scales with 5g accuracy, and time was measured
by a stopwatch SDS with 0.2 sec
accuracy.</p>

<p class="body"> Exhaust
smoke was set with accuracy 3% by TECNOTEST-490 opacimeter (TECNOTEST, Parma,
Italy). Exhaust emission composition was measured by gas analyzer TECNOTEST-481
(TECNOTEST, Parma, Italy). Engine characteristics were tested at a constant
rotation frequency n=1600
min<sup>-1</sup>. The mode is selected by adjusting fuel supply lever and
changing engine load. Before starting measurements, having changed engine
running mode, the engine was allowed to operate for 5 min. When changing the
type of fuel, used fuel was released from fuel filters and supply tubes, also
cleaning filter elements were replaced. Supply system was filled with fuel by
manual pump, and air was removed. Fuel remaining from previous operation in
high-pressure pump, pipes and sprinklers were consumed by engine operation and
determining its operation mode. </p>

<p class="body"> Engine is
started with stand assistance; it is warmed up to operating temperature, and
the required operating mode is set. It is allowed to work in the set mode for
5-7 minutes. After that, time during which 100 or 200 g of fuel is burned was
fixed (depending on engine load). At the same time, exhaust emissions and smoke
composition was measured by gas analyser TECNOTEST-481. Smoke
opacity determined with &plusmn;3% accuracy.</p>

<p class="body"> The technical-economical
calculations of the cogeneration power plant were carried
out by comparing the cogeneration power plant indicators using
commercial mineral diesel and in the domestic conditions obtained rapeseed oil.
Technological comparative calculations were carried out by the methodology
approved and used in the Aleksandras Stulginskis University [21, 22].</p>



<h4>3. Results and discussion</h4>

<p class="body"> Based
on the results of experimental studies of the test engine performance and an
analysis of information sources, for practical applications has been selected
high power (1050 kW) diesel engine. Calculated analytically energy flow
distribution in cogeneration power plant with this selected diesel engine is
presented in figure 3. </p>

<p class="body">It was
determined that mechanical power of the engine is more than twice smaller than
the power of heating module. Thus, total energetic efficiency is highly
dependent on the fact how effectively heat obtained by cogeneration is used.
Within May-September, it is almost impossible to achieve efficient operating in
energy system of one block of the power plant. Compared to winter months, heat
demand makes only 10-20% [13]. Meanwhile, demand of electricity changes
insignificantly. However, exploitation of several energetic blocks of smaller
power and switching them on with the first needs of heat energy is not the most
optimal variant. Firstly, total efficiency of such power plant reduces, and
investment costs increase. The system gets rather complicated to manage. It is
possible for cogeneration power plants to stabilise operating mode by directing
energy obtained from heat exchangers and recuperators to cooling and
conditioning systems [9, 10]. </p>

<p class="body">Experimentally determined and calculated hourly (B<sub>d</sub>)
and relative (b<sub>e</sub>) rates of fuel consumption, depending on the engine
brake power (P<sub>e</sub>) working with mineral diesel (MD), rapeseed oil
methyl ester (RME) and rape seed oil (oil), data is presented in Table 3.</p>

<p class="body">Exhaust smoke is the largest when the engine operates in medium
load mode. Having replaced mineral diesel with RME,exhaust smoke reduced to 68% and if
replaced with pure oil - to 72%. When
operating on blends of these fuels,
smoke opacity decreases
with increasingRMEcontentin the blend.</p>

<p class="body">Summarizingthe obtained results there were concluded, that the assessment
of the
relative NO<sub>x</sub>and CO emissions of the
gases and smoke, RME and rapeseed oil has a better impact on the
environment.Compared to mineral diesel,RME and rapeseed oil lags behind
only by NO<sub>x</sub> emissions
exhausted from the engine tothe environment.
This problem
can be solved by
adjusting the engine or installing catalytic converters in the
exhaust system.</p>

<p class="body">Having evaluated
quantity of electric and heat energy produced in cogeneration power plants, its
efficiency would make up to 79095 EUR/year.The payback period of such power
plants would reach1.76years on the average, it is about twice less than payback using
mineral diesel.</p>

<h4>5. Conclusions</h4>

<ol>
 <li>The performed
     literature analysis showed that diesel engines using liquid or gas fuels
     are the most perspective for small and medium power cogeneration power
     plants in Lithuania. </li><br>
<li>Ensuring independence
     of producers of dispersed energy from fuel suppliers and reduction of
     dangerous emission to the environment, it is purposeful to use personal
     production rapeseed oil and its blends with mineral diesel as fuel in
     cogeneration power plants. </li><br>
 <li>It has been
     determined that using biofuels in cogeneration power plant with diesel
     engine, mechanical power is twice smaller than the received heat in module
     power. </li><br>
 <li>Having performed
     environmental evaluation of biofuel it was determined that the least
     emission of CO and solid particles to the environment is achieved if using
     rapeseed oil as fuel. However, during its burning, higher amount of NO<sub>x</sub>
     is emitted than using mineral diesel or rapeseed ester methyl. </li><br>
 <li>If
     compared options of using rapeseed oil as
     fuel in cogeneration power plants, after
     evaluation of quantities electric and heat energy produced in cogeneration
     power plants, it may be stated that its efficiency would make up to 79095
     EUR/year, and the payback period of such power plants is about twice less
     than payback using mineral diesel. This is explained by lower rapeseed
     production costs compared to mineral diesel costs. </li>
