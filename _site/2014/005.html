    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Fed-batch, solid state, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) was evaluated as an approach to reduce enzyme use in converting cellulose to ethanol, and to maximize ethanol titer. Kraft pulp, an intermediate in paper production, was used to represent a fractionated cellulose feedstock. Following a literature survey, average dosages were determined as 34 FPU of cellulase (Celluclast 1.5L) and 135 CBU of &beta;-glucosidase (Novozyme 188) per gram glucan, and were set as 100% dosages. Initially, submerged fed-batch SSF trials were conducted in a traditional bioreactor using enzyme dosages of 17, 33, 67, and 133%, with a final solids loading rate (SLR) of 14%. Ethanol production was similar (77.3-83.4% of theoretical yield) for trials with 33-133% enzyme dosages, but fell to 36% of theoretical at 17% enzyme dosage. Fed-batch saccharification and fed-batch SSF were then performed in a solid state bioreactor, achieving a 34.8% SLR. This reduced the initial 133% enzyme dosage to 19%. In saccharification trials the glucose yield was only 35% of theoretical (103.6 g/L), due to feedback inhibition of enzymes. Companion SSF trials achieved an ethanol yield of only 20% of theoretical (30.1 g/L ethanol). While some ethanol was lost due to evaporation, yeast inhibition by low water activity was presumed to be the primary limitation. Performance at lower solid loading rates were evaluated, and even diluted the fermented slurry and conducted a secondary fermentation. These trials suggest that enzyme inactivation via irreversible binding may be the primary limitation, instead of low water activity or nutrient limitation.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Submerged
bioreactors have traditionally been used for fermentation processes, including
large scale systems common in corn ethanol facilities. Submerged bioreactors
allow for precise control of temperature, pH, agitation, aeration, and mass
transfer. The chief limitation is viscosity of the fermentation broth, as this
limits mixing/mass transfer, and dramatically increases agitation energy
requirements [1]. Thus, the solids loading rate in submerged bioreactors is
limited by flow characteristics of the slurry and the forces exerted on the
motor and impellers. Different types of solids can result in significantly
different flow properties, even at the same solid loading rate [2]. For
example, corn ethanol production typically employs &gt;30% solid loading rate
to achieve ethanol titers of &gt;150 g/L. However because lignocellulosic
biomass has a much lower bulk density, it is estimated that submerged
bioreactors will only accommodate 10-15% solid loading, resulting in ethanol
titers of 40-60 g/L [3]. These dilute, slurries will require substantially
larger bioreactor volumes (and operational costs) along with greater energy
input for ethanol recovery.</p>

<p class="body">Another
option for dealing with low bulk density feedstocks is to perform an initial
saccharification of a dilute slurry, then remove the non-fermentable
through filtration or centrifugation, and finally concentrate liquid through evaporation
to achieve a clean solution with the desired sugar concentration for
fermentation. One disadvantages of this method would be feedback inhibition of
the enzymes during saccharification, resulting in incomplete sugar release [4, 5].
Also, if the non-fermentable solids are not washed, some sugar will be lost
with these solids. The other major disadvantage of this approach would be the
large amounts of energy necessary to concentrate the sugar solutions,
especially if solids are washed. </p>

<p class="body">An
alternative to these methods is solid state conversion, in which a minimum
amount of water is added, so simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
(SSF) occur in the liquid film on solid particles [6, 7]. This would maximize
solids loading and ethanol concentration, while minimizing energy needed for
ethanol recovery [8]. There are many advantages of using a solid state
fermentation system: lower production cost, less energy needed, and greater
fermentation productivity [9]. Gibbons et al [10, 11] used solid state
fermentation to convert sweet sorghum and fodder beet pulp to ethanol achieving
ethanol yields of 85% and 78-85% of theoretical, respectively. Moukamnerd et al
[9] used a solid state fermentation system to convert raw corn starch to ethanol.
Ethanol was recovered continuously, with an ethanol yield of 93%. The purpose
of the project herein was to compare submerged bioreactors versus solid state
bioreactors at various solid loading rates of a cellulosic substrate. The goal
was to minimize enzyme use, while maximizing ethanol production.</p>

<h4>2. Materials and Methods </h4>

<p class="subhead">2.1 Enzymes, Yeast, Substrate, and Other
Materials</p>

<p class="body">Enzymes used
in this study were obtained as a gift from Novozymes. Celluclast 1.5 L is a
cellulase enzyme and has an activity of 4460.6 EGU/ml. Novozyme 188 is a
&#946;-glucosidase and has an activity of 18,150 CBU/ml. Enzymes were stored at
4 <sup>o</sup>C.
Previously, we surveyed the literature and calculated the average dosage for
Celluclast 1.5L (34 FPU /g glucan) and Novozyme 188 (135 CBU /g glucan) [12,
13]. These dosages were set to equal as
100%, and then we evaluated higher and lower enzyme dosages based on these literature values.
</p>

<p class="body"><i>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae </i>NRRL Y-2034
was provided by the USDA National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research,
Peoria, IL. For short term maintenance the yeast was stored on Potato Dextrose
Agar Plates (PDA) plates and slants at 4 <sup>o</sup>C.
Lyophilization was used for long term storage. Inoculum for all experiments was
prepared by transferring colonies into a 5% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract broth
(100 ml in 250 Erlenmeyer flasks), then incubating for 24 h at 35<sup>o</sup>C
in a 250 rpm rotary shaker. Cell counts of the inoculum were nominally in the 3-6 x
10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml range. </p>

<p class="body">Kraft pulp
was used as the substrate and was obtained as a gift from the Paper Science and
Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point, and
consisted of: 76.7% glucan, 0.5% arabinan, 7.7% xylan, 0.3% galactan, 6.7%
mannan, and 3.2% lignin. The buffer solution consisted of 34.4 g sodium citrate
per liter of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 4.8 using 14 M HCl. A
stock solution of tetracycline (10 &micro;m/ml in 70% ethanol) was prepared and
stored in the freezer. To control contamination, 5.3-6 ml of the tetracycline
solution was added per liter of fermentation broth. Condensed corn solubles
(CCS) was added as a low cost nutrient source for the yeast, and was obtained
as a gift from a dry mill ethanol plant. Table 1 shows an analysis of CCS. </p>

<p class="subhead">2.2 Effects of Enzyme Dosage on Fed-batch
Submerged SSF of Kraft Pulp</p>

<p class="body">Trials in
triplicate were conducted in a 5 L New Brunswick BioFlow III bioreactor to
determine if fed-batch additions of kraft pulp could be made without the need
for additional enzymes. The top portion of Table 2 lists the components initially
added to bioreactors for treatments, resulting in final enzyme dosages of 17-133%
of the literature average. Each bioreactor was also charged with 5.3 ml
tetracycline solution, 10 g CCS and 20 ml of <i>S. cerevisiae.</i> The
temperature was set at 35 <sup>o</sup>C and the agitation rate
was initially set to 900 rpm so adequate mixing was achieved. After ~30 min the
broth became less viscous, and the agitation rate was reduced to 75-100 rpm.
The bottom portion of Table 2 lists the components added at 3, 6, and 24 h
during the fed-batch process. The total volume of all trials was 2,856 ml,
resulting in a total solid loading rate (SLR) of 14%. </p>

<p class="subhead">2.3 Fed-batch Saccharification in a Solid State
Bioreactor </p>

<p class="body">To assess the
performance of a solid state bioreactor we constructed, initial trials were
performed in triplicate using fed-batch saccharification. The reactor (Figure
1) has a 16 L internal capacity with a horizontal shaft and paddles driven by a
0.373 kW variable speed motor (20-60 rpm). The reactor was placed within a
static incubator for temperature control. The bioreactor was initially loaded
with 1,380 ml of sodium citrate buffer, 54 ml of cellulase enzyme, 60 ml of
&#946;-glucosidase enzyme, 6 ml of tetracycline solution, and 100 g of kraft
pulp. This provided an initial enzyme dosage of 133% and a SLR of 15%. The
temperature was set to 35 <sup>o</sup>C instead of 50 <sup>o</sup>C,
so the results would be more directly comparable to subsequent SSF trials. The
agitation rate was set to 60 rpm, and saccharification was performed for 96 h.
At 3, 6, and 9 h, 100 g of kraft pulp were added, and at 24 and 36 h, 200 g of
kraft pulp were added, resulting in a final SLR of 34.8% and a final volume of
2,300 L.
No additional enzymes were added, resulting in a final enzyme dosage of 19%.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.4 Fed-batch SSF in a Solid State Bioreactor </p>

<p class="body">Initial
fed-batch SSF trials were performed in triplicate following a similar protocol
to that described above for fed-batch saccharification, except that all
components were proportionally increased to achieve a final volume of 12 L. The
second column of Table 3 lists the materials used in the 34.8% SLR trial and the
final enzyme dosage. A 24 h yeast inoculum and CCS (to supply yeast nutrients)
were also added initially. </p>

<p class="body">Temperature and
agitation were set to 35<sup>o</sup>C and 60 rpm, respectively, for the 96 h
SSF. Due to inadequate conversion efficiency in the 34.8% SLR trial, presumably
caused by low water activity, we gradually reduced the total SLR in subsequent
trials as shown in the remaining columns of Table 3. We also tested a 14% SLR for
comparison with the fed-batch SSF trials in the submerged bioreactor.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.5 Secondary Analysis of Fed-Batch, Solid State
SSF Samples </p>

<p class="body">To quantify
the level of un-hydrolyzed cellulose remaining in the kraft pulp slurries at 0,
24, 48, 72, and 96 h, samples were collected and subjected to an additional
saccharification. Each 5 ml sample of fermentation broth was blended with 89.3
ml of buffer in a stoppered, 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. After autoclaving to kill
the yeast, 2.7 ml of cellulase and 3 ml of &#946;-glucosidase were added (133%
enzymes dosage) to the cooled slurry, which was incubated at 250 rpm at 50 <sup>o</sup>C
for 72 h. Glucose levels were determined by HPLC analysis at 0 and 72 h, and
difference was used to calculate the amount of un-hydrolyzed cellulose present.
</p>

<p class="body">During the
fed-batch SSF trials in the solid state bioreactor we noted high levels of
glucose and lower levels of ethanol than we expected. We hypothesized that
either nutrients or water activity may have limited yeast metabolism. Therefore
samples were collected at 96h SSF and were subjected to the following tests. In
one set of 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, varying amounts of buffer were added (10,
25, 50 or 100 ml) to 100 g quantities of fermented pulp to determine if water
activity was limiting. In a separate flask, 49 ml of buffer and 1 g of yeast
extract were added to 100 g of fermented pulp to determine if nutrients were
limiting. These flasks were incubated an additional 72 h at 35<sup>o</sup>C in
a rotary shaker (250 rpm), with HPLC analysis at 0 and 72 h.</p>


<p class="subhead">2.6 Analytical Methods</p>

<p class="body">Samples (5
ml) were removed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h during the trials.
To ensure sample uniformity, samples were collected with 10 ml wide mouth
pipets. Samples were placed in sealed centrifuge tubes and boiled for five min
to denature enzymes. Samples were the filtered through 0.2 &micro;m filters into auto-sampler
vials which were frozen until analysis. Carbohydrates, organic acids, and
ethanol were measured in a Waters HPLC, with an Aminex HPX-87H column, and
Waters 2410 refractive index detector. The mobile phase was 0.01 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
at a flow rate of 0.6 ml per minute.</p>

<h4>3. Results and
Discussion</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1
Effects of Enzyme Dosage on Fed-Batch Submerged SSF of Kraft Pulp</p>

<p class="body">A 14% SLR of
kraft pulp was used to evaluate fed-batch submerged SSF at enzyme dosages of
133, 67, 33, and 17% of the average listed in the literature. Based on the
glucan content of the kraft pulp, the theoretical yields of glucose and ethanol
were 120.9 g/L and 61.7 g/L, respectively. Figure 2 shows the average ethanol
concentrations of these four enzyme dosages during the 96 h SSF period. Final
ethanol titers of ~48-51 g/L were achieved with enzyme dosages of 133%, 67%,
and 33%. These represented ethanol yields of 77-83% of theoretical and
indicated that enzyme dosage could be safely reduced to 33% of the literature
average (11.25 FPU cellulase and 45 CBU &#946;-glucosidase per gram glucan). We
do not have an explanation for the delayed ethanol production observed in the
133% enzyme dosage trial, but this trend was consistent for all replications. Maximum
ethanol titer (22.23 g/L) and theoretical yield (36%) at the 17% enzyme dosage
demonstrated that this level was insufficient for effective SSF. </p>

<p class="body">Glucose
concentrations during fermentation showed a typical early peak, since enzymatic
saccharification rates initially exceed glucose consumption rates during the
yeast growth phase (data not shown). After 24 h SSF, glucose levels were
minimal, and final residual glucose levels were 0.43- 2.24 g/L in all trials.
Cellobiose was not detected during SSF, while xylose (2.84-5.55 g/L)
accumulated during fermentation, with higher concentrations in the higher
enzyme dosage trials (data not shown). This was expected, since the <i>S.
cerevisiae</i> strain Y-2034 cannot metabolize xylose [14].</p>

</figure>


<p class="body">Table 4 lists
the maximum ethanol titer, productivity, and residual glucose levels for these
trials.
As discussed above, the onset of ethanol production
was delayed in the 13% enzyme dosage trial. This was correlated with a
higher and more variable residual glucose titer. Thus it is possible that some unknown
factor inhibited yeast metabolism in this treatment. These
parameters are similar for enzyme dosages above 33%, showing that fed-batch SSF
is an effective mechanism to reduce enzyme dosage [4, 15]. Kuhad et al. [4]
also found that fed-batch feeding of substrate (de-inked newsprint) during SSF
allowed an increase in SLR (from 2% to 6%), resulting in 14.78 g/L ethanol (85%
yield) based on the 51% cellulose content of the newspaper. However, their
final enzyme dosages (cellulase at 115% and &#946;-glucosidase at 87% of the
literature average) were significantly higher than used herein. Ballesteros et
al. [15] used fed-batch feeding of recycled paper at 42<sup>o</sup>C to
increase SLR from 5 to 10%. At a final enzyme dosage of 100% of the literature
average for cellulase they obtained an ethanol yield of 79.7%. In the trials
reported herein, enzyme dosage was reduced to 33% at a higher SLR (14%), and
still achieved approximately the same ethanol yield (77%) </p>

<p class="subhead">3.2 Fed-batch Saccharification in Solid State
Bioreactor</p>

<p class="body">To determine
if lower enzyme dosages would work at an even higher SLR (34.8%), fed-batch
saccharification was conducted in the solid state, paddle type bioreactor.
Initial enzyme dosages were 133% of the literature average, but since no
additional enzymes were added during saccharification, the final enzyme dosage
was 19% of the literature average. Incubation was conducted at 35<sup>o</sup>C
instead of the normal 50<sup>o</sup>C so the results would be more comparable
to subsequent SSF trials. Based on the solids loading and glucan content of the
kraft pulp, the theoretical amount of glucose available was 296.1 g/L. Figures 3A and 3B show
the saccharifiying mixture within the solid state bioreactor immediately before
and after the third additions of 100 g of kraft pulp at 6 h. By 9 h the pulp
liquefied sufficiently so that an additional 100 g of kraft pulp could be
added. Similar trends of viscosity reductions occurred following the remaining
kraft pulp additions at 9 h (100 g) and 24 and 36 h (200 g each). Thus the
solid state bioreactor design was effective in mixing to at least 34.8% total
SLR. </p>

<p class="body">The maximum
glucose level during saccharification was 103.6 g/L, which was achieved by 48
h, and represented 35% of the theoretical yield (Figure 4). Cellobiose levels
also peaked at ~48 h, reaching 28 g/L. Dextrin (DP4) levels were relatively low
(10-13 g/L) throughout. These finding were not unexpected, as it is known that
cellulose deconstructing enzymes are inhibited by the build of up glucose and
cellobiose [4, 5]. Low levels of
xylose were expected, since kraft pulp contains low levels of xylan. </p>

<p class="body">Using dilute
acid pretreated corn stover, Rochel et al. [16] achieved 62% glucose yield
after 96 h of batch saccharification (48<sup>o</sup>C) in a horizontal
paddle-type reactor at a lower SLR of 20% (compared to 34.8% in our trials).
Based on the literature average, their enzyme dosages were 28% for cellulase
(Spezyme CP), compared to 19% in our trials. Jorgensen et al [17] achieved a
38% glucose yield after 96 h of batch saccharification of hot water treated
wheat straw at 35% SLR, but their cellulase dosage was higher, at 25-40% of the
literature average. Therefore, using a higher cellulose content feedstock, similar
results to Jorgensen et al [17] were achieved at the same solids loading, but
using half as much enzyme, and at a lower temperature. </p>

<p class="subhead">3.3 Fed-batch SSF in a Solid State Bioreactor </p>

<p class="body">Fed-batch SSF
(following the same protocol as described above, except that <i>S. cerevisiae</i>
was added at 0 h) was next conducted to assess whether conversion yields could
be improved by continuously converting glucose into ethanol to minimize enzyme
repression [8]. The first trial was conducted at a 34.8% SLR, with subsequent
trials performed at SLR of 27, 25, 21, and 14% to reduce potentially adverse
impacts of low water activity. Based on the glucan content of kraft pulp, the
theoretical ethanol yield for the 34.8% SLR trial was 151 g/L, and
progressively less for the other SLRs tested. Figure 5 shows the residual
glucose levels, while figure 6 shows ethanol titers for these trials. Glucose
levels rose during the first 12 h (yeast growth stage), but then fell as
ethanol production began. However at 24 h in the 34.8% solid loading rate,
glucose levels again began to rise, and continued to increase at approximately
the same rate until peaking at 72 h (~70 g/L). This indicated that yeast
metabolism was repressed, perhaps by the combination of low water activity and
high ethanol titer [5]. In the other SLR trials, glucose levels fell to ~0 g/L
by 96 h. Ethanol titers rose throughout incubation for all trials, then slowed
as yeast metabolism was reduced. The highest ethanol titers of 48-50 g/L were
obtained in the 25 and 27% SLR trials. This trend is also reflected in figure 7,
which shows that ethanol yield in these trials was 42-44% of theoretical. </p>

<p class="body">During the 96
h of SSF in the solid state reactor we noted a strong evaporative loss of
ethanol. This was most noticeable during sample removal and addition of fresh
kraft pulp, but because it was not possible to completely seal the lid of the
reactor, ethanol was continuously volatilized. We believe this is the primary
reason for the differences observed between the prior submerged SSF trial at
14% SLR (47.65 g/L ethanol, 77.2% yield at 33% enzyme dosage) and the
comparable 14% SLR trial in the solid state reactor (30 g/L ethanol, 48.6%
yield at 39% enzyme dosage). If this ~37% loss in ethanol is applied to the
25-27% SLR trials, maximal ethanol titers and yields would have increased to 67
g/L and 59%.</p>

<p class="body">The kraft
pulp slurry was monitored for un-hydrolyzed cellulose at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96
h by subjecting samples to autoclaving (to kill yeast), followed by dosing with
enzyme and conducting an additional 72 h saccharification. Significant levels
of cellulose were present throughout SSF for all SLR trials (data not shown),
along with the high glucose levels shown in the 34.8% SLR trial. Unfortunately,
due to moisture loss (ethanol and water) from the solid state pulp during
autoclaving, it was not possible to calculate the percent conversion of
cellulose. However this demonstrated that cellulose hydrolysis was limited by
some factor in the solid state SSF process. </p>

<p class="body">Jorgensen et
al [17] conducted a separate hydrolysis (8 h at 50<sup>0</sup>C) of hot water
treated wheat straw at 35% solids loading, using enzyme levels of 34% of the
literature average. After 144 h fermentation they obtained 39% of the
theoretical ethanol yield, compared to the ~20% yield we obtained with a 19%
enzyme dosage. Zhang et al [8] conducted fed-batch SSF of corncobs pretreated
with dilute sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and aqueous ammonia pretreatment
or simple soaking in aqueous ammonia. At a final solids loading of 25% and
using a cellulase dosage of 67% of the literature average, they obtained
ethanol yields of 67.8%- 89%. This compares to the 44% yield (or 60% if
corrected for ethanol evaporative loss) we obtained at 25% SLR, but required three
times more enzyme than the 22% dosage we used at this SLR. Thus enzyme dosage
appears to play an even more critical role at higher SLRs, likely due to the
increased viscosity that would reduce mass transfer [18, 19, 20]. </p>

<p class="body">To further explore
why ethanol yields were lower than expected during fed-batch SSF, 100 g
quantities of the fermented slurry were mixed with 10, 25, 50, and 100 ml of
buffer, and the flasks were incubated at 35<sup>o</sup>C for an additional 72 h
at 250 rpm. To assess whether yeast nutrients were limiting, 100 g of
fermented slurry was also incubated with 49 ml of buffer and 1 g of yeast
extract. Figure 8 shows ethanol yields from the undiluted and diluted samples
for each initial SLR trail. As can be seen, adding yeast extract along with 50
ml of water did not improve ethanol yields, thus indicating that nutrients were
not limiting ethanol yields. Only a slight improvement in ethanol yield was
noted when fermented material from the 25% solid loading rate trial was diluted
and incubated an additional 72 h. No benefit was observed in the 27% solid
loading rate trials. The only significant increase in ethanol yield was when
100 g of the 21% solid loading rate material was diluted with 10 ml of water
and fermented 72 h more. Based on these findings it doesn't appear that water
activity was the primary limiting factor. Instead we postulate that low enzyme
activity may be the chief limitation, since residual sugar levels also remained
low in these secondary fermentations of diluted samples. As noted by other
investigators, a significant issue with cellulase enzymes in irreversible
binding to biomass components [18, 19, 20, 21,22]. </p>

<h4>4. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">The goal of
this project was evaluate fed-batch, solid state, simultaneous saccharification
and fermentation (SSF) as an approach to reduce enzymes used in converting
cellulose to ethanol and to increase then solids loading to maximize ethanol
titer. During fed-batch submerged SSF of kraft pulp there were no significant
differences between the final ethanol concentrations (47-52 g/l) or yield
(77-83%) when enzyme dosages were reduced from 133% to 33% of the average
dosage calculated from the literature. It was possible to achieve a solids
loading rate of 14% and still maintain adequate mixing.</p>

<p class="body">During
fed-batch saccharification trials in solid state bioreactor, 34.8% solids
loading was achieved with an acceptable mixing rate, while reducing enzyme
dosage to 19% of the literature average. Due to feedback inhibition of enzymes,
however, glucose levels only reached ~100 g/L, which was 35% of the theoretical
yield. To prevent feedback inhibition [4, 5] fed-batch SSF trials were
conducted under identical conditions. Due to apparent yeast inhibition caused
by low water activity [4], the ethanol yield only rose to 20% of theoretical,
while glucose levels rose to 70 g/L. We then evaluated performance at solid
loading rates of 21, 25, and 27% and ethanol yields increased to 42-44%,
confirming that low water activity was at least partially responsible for low ethanol
yields. However, in comparison to a submerged SSF trial at 14% SLR, we observed
a 37% loss of ethanol from the solid state reactor due to evaporation. We also
detected substantial levels of unhydrolyzed cellulose in these trials. We then
further diluted the fermented slurry and conducted a secondary fermentation. This
did not substantially improve ethanol yields or cellulose hydrolysis,
suggesting that enzyme inactivation via irreversible binding may be responsible
[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. </p>
